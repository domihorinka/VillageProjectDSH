# VillageProjectDSH

I have created a base homepage for users to explore what Village is. From this page, users can find a program, plan a program, sign up, and read about Village all from the header. At the bottom of the page, users can subscribe to a newsletter, contact Village, see FAQ's, and again, read more about the company. The site also mobile responsive making it accesible from your mobile device.

## Lessons Learned

I spent about 4 hours on this as I kept running into some issues. This is my second version of the project as the first had a bug I could not find, so I started over. If I had not run into those issues and had to start over, I'm confident I could have done more with this task.
